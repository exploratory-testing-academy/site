    <i>The core idea of designing and building these courses is to center a single application per course, and teach 
    exploratory testing as it makes sense for that application. Together we hope the examples give you a good wider perspective 
    teaching into many things important in testing.</i>
    <p>
    <i>Things about projects are hard to teach with a snapshot of an application and we will most likely include 
    case studies of projects to support mapping of what you may have as starting point in a project to what you would do.</i>

    <p>
    Welcome to Exploratory Testing Foundations -course. This course intertwines
    a simple application (E-Primer) to test with basic theory of how to do exploratory
    testing to give you a foundation to build on.
    <p>
    Exploratory testing is an approach to testing that centers learning.
    Test design and test execution form an inseparable pair where the application
    and feature we are testing is our external imagination. It takes domain
    knowledge, requirements and specifications, and testing knowledge as input
    and produces information and a better tester as an output. It usually also
    encourages us to at least consider documentation and test automation as a
    form of documentation.
    <p>
    I think of this course as an antidote to the idea that test cases tell you
    how to test a feature and that is where a new tester would start. That type
    of test cases are only a small subset. You are expected to find defects,
    where the system does not work as we specified but not stop there. Finding
    change requests, things that would make things better for users is included.
    And instead of using most of your work time on documentation, I'm inviting
    you to consider lighter and executable formats of documenting.
    <p>
    This is what we fit into one day with one application. Theory and applying
    the theory go hand in hand. When taught in classroom, we will also reflect
    course experiences to work experiences and share stories of testing
    in projects where applicable.

    <h2>Exploratory Unit Testing</h2>
    <i> Work on this content has started but progress is sporadical</i>
    <p>
   On Exploratory Unit Testing -course, we do exploratory testing on a unit level. We'll work with a few examples, 
   and extensive programming understanding is not necessary. Programming knowledge won't hurt either. 
    <p>

    <h2>Real-World Exploratory Testing</h2>
    <i> Work on this content has been sporadical starting 2021</i>
    <p>
    On Real-World Exploratory Testing -course, we look at testing an application that 
    is web technologies frontend and backend. The programmer community has built a demo application 
    we believe is not riddled with bugs, but also does not come with a strong accompanying suite of programmed tests 
    nor a good idea of how applications like this would be tested. 
    <p>
    This course looks at exploratory testing on user interface level (documenting with automation), on API level 
    and on unit testing level. How would you test <a href="https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld">Conduit</a>?
